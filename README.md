# Github Automator

This ia a project that makes your starting of the project smooth.


For Instance As a programmer while stating a project we first 

make a folder 

Initialise the git repository 

then make a readme file 

go to github and create a new repository 

copy the remote

add it as origin 

and then start our coding process 


but with the help of the project you can just run the create.py file and it does all it for you

and by the time it does the work you can make some coffee.




## Things You have to change before you can use it

Change all the credentials according to your needs listed from lines 9 to 15 in the create.py file.
 
The Github Username and password is required to login to Github.

And make sure to give the email that is used to create your Github account. 
It is needed to get the verification code which Github Sometimes askes at the time of login.

And then run this and you are done


Note that till now this only works for Windows and the linux version will also be comming soon.
```bash
  python create.py
```
